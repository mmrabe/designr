\usage{
output.design(design, group_by = NULL, order_by = NULL,
  randomize = FALSE, rename_random = TRUE)

design.formula(design, contrasts = NULL,
  expand.contrasts = !missing(contrasts), interactions = TRUE,
  intercepts = TRUE, response = "dv", env = parent.frame())

design.units(design, rename_random = TRUE)

design.codes(design, group_by = NULL, order_by = NULL,
  randomize = FALSE, rename_random = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{The \code{factorDesign} object to summarize.}

\item{group_by}{If not \code{NULL}, the design matrix is grouped by these factors. Factors must be valid columns of the design matrix. If used, \code{$codes} will be a list matched to the entries in \code{$groups}.}

\item{order_by}{If not \code{NULL}, output within each output group is ordered by these columns.}

\item{randomize}{After ordering, remaining rows in the same order rank are randomly shuffled.}

\item{rename_random}{Should random factor levels be renamed? If \code{TRUE}, levels are renamed as strings composed of the factor name and factor level (e.g., Subj01, Subj02, ...). \code{FALSE} disables renaming of random factor levels. Alternatively, you may provide a function which should accept the vectorized ID (integer) as a first argument and the name (single character value) of the random factor as second argument or ignore it. Functions such as \code{as.double} or \code{as.integer} *are* possible because they ignore the second argument and only convert the ID.}

\item{contrasts}{The contrasts to override (\code{NULL} if none to override)}

\item{expand.contrasts}{If \code{TRUE}, factors with more than one contrast are replaced by so many contrasts, i.e. the result contains the names of the individual contrasts, not of the factors.}

\item{interactions}{Should fixed effects be additive or interactive?}

\item{intercepts}{Should an intercept be included?}

\item{response}{The left-hand side of the equation. Typically, this is just the response/dependent variable.}

\item{env}{The environment in which to embed the formula}
}
\value{
\code{output.design} returns a list containing all output summaries, including the following named entities:
\describe{
  \item{\code{codes}}{Either a \code{tibble} with all experimental codes or a list of \code{tibble}s of experimental codes. The list entries are matched to the rows of \code{$groups}.}
  \item{\code{groups}}{If grouped, contains a tibble in which each row represents an output group, matched to the entries in $codes. If not grouped, this is \code{NULL}.}
  \item{\code{ordered}}{If ordered, contains a vector of order criteria. If not ordered, this is \code{NULL}.}
  \item{\code{randomized}}{Value of \code{randomized}.}
  \item{\code{units}}{A list of random factors and their levels for this design as tibbles. Empty list if no random factors in the design.}
  \item{\code{formulas}}{A list of possible model formulas for use with functions such as \code{lm()} and \code{lmer()}.}
}

The functions \code{design.codes}, \code{design.formula} and \code{design.units} only return the values of the fields \code{codes} (a \code{tibble} or list or \code{tibble}s of experimental codes), \code{formulas} (a list of model formulas), and \code{units} (a list of random factors and their levels), respectively.
}
\description{
These functions return useful summaries of a factor design, including the design matrix itself as well as other parameters and a list of random factors as experimental units.
}
\details{
The function \code{design.units} returns the experimental units of the design. Those are defined by random factors and their levels. See \code{units} return value below.

\code{design.codes} returns a dataframe or \code{tibble} of all planned observations including each observation's experimental codes, i.e. fixed and random factor levels. If you group the output, a list is returned. See \code{codes} return value below.

\code{design.formula} returns a list of formulas suitable for regression analysis. Currently, formulas for \code{lm} and \code{lme4} are returned. See \code{formulas} entry,
