*designr* is an R package to create and simulate crossed factorial designs.

## Installation

Install from CRAN within R using:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("designr")
```

Install the development version in R using `devtools`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mmrabe/designr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Random and fixed factors

*designr* supports factorial designs with an arbitrary number of fixed and random factors. Fixed factors are factors for which levels are known and typically defined by the experimenter, e.g. an experimental condition or a quasi-experimental variable such as a subject’s age group. Conversely, the instances of random factors are usually not known before data collection. Examples for random factors are subjects or items in a typical psychological experiment, with the individual tested subjects and used items being the instances of those random factors.

## Simple fixed-effects design

A fixed-effects design without repeated measurement is created as easily as this:

```{r}
design1 <- 
  fixed.factor("Age", levels=c("young", "old")) +
  fixed.factor("Material",  levels=c("word", "image"))
design1
```

As can be seen, this experimental design requires `r nobs(design1)` observations.

## Adding random factors

Assume we want to test different groups of subjects. Each subject will only be `old` or `young` but be tested with stimuli of both categories `word` and `image`. In a typical behavioral experiment, `Age` would now be a between-subject/within-item factor and `Material` a within-subject/between-item factor. In other words, `Material` is now nested within the instances of `Subject`, whereas `Subject` is grouped by `Age`.

```{r}
design2 <- 
  fixed.factor("Age", levels=c("young", "old")) +
  fixed.factor("Material",  levels=c("word", "image")) +
  random.factor("Subject", groups = "Age")
design.codes(design2)
```

The minimal experimental design will still require `r nobs(design2)` observations, assigning one subject to each level of the between-subject factor `Age`.

## Nested designs

Note that `design1` is nested within `design2`. This means that instead of defining `design2` like we did above, we can also derive it from the existing `design1` by adding the random factor `Subject` like so:

```{r}
design2 <- 
  design1 +
  random.factor("Subject", groups = "Age")
```

## Crossed random factors

Oftentimes, experiments will have more than one random factor, for example `Subject` and `Item`. This is because items in behavioral experiments are often prepared upfront and not randomly generated upon presentation. In that case we would like to make sure that each item is presented equally often across all subjects and within-item conditions. Suppose that we are extending our example from above by a second random factor `Item`. Contrary to `Subject`, `Item` is grouped by `Material` because each item can only be a `word` or `image` but it may be presented to both `old` and `young` subjects.

```{r}
design3 <- 
  fixed.factor("Age", levels=c("young", "old")) +
  fixed.factor("Material",  levels=c("word", "image")) +
  random.factor("Subject", groups = "Age") +
  random.factor("Item", groups = "Material")
design.codes(design3)
```

In this design, we plan to test 2 subjects, one `young` and one `old`, and each of them will be presented two items, an `image` and a `word`. The items will appear equally often in the levels of `Age` and subjects will see an equal number of items in all levels of `Material`.

## Counterbalancing

Note that in the example above, each item really only appears once per subject. However, suppose we introduce a third fixed factor, which varies within subjects and within items, i.e. it is neither a subject nor item level fixed property. This could be something like the contrast on the screen or some other experimental manipulation that is pseudo-randomly varied for each subject and each item.

The resulting design may look something like this:

```{r}
design4 <- 
  fixed.factor("Age", levels=c("young", "old")) +
  fixed.factor("Material",  levels=c("word", "image")) +
  fixed.factor("Contrast",  levels=c("high", "low")) +
  random.factor("Subject", groups = "Age") +
  random.factor("Item", groups = "Material")
design.codes(design4)
```

In a fully crossed and balanced experimental design, each item would now be presented twice per subject, once with `high` and once with `low` contrast. This can be absolutely legitimate, depending on the research question. In many behavioral experiments, however, the experimenter may wish to prevent the same item from being presented twice because that could introduce unwanted effects.

Essentially, what we want to do is to group each `Subject`×`Item` pairing by `Contrast`, i.e. we want to ensure that each item assigned to a subject is only assigned in either `high` or `low` contrast. We can therefore add the interaction of `Subject` and `Item` as a random factor, grouped by `Contrast`:

```{r}
design5 <- 
  fixed.factor("Age", levels=c("young", "old")) +
  fixed.factor("Material",  levels=c("word", "image")) +
  fixed.factor("Contrast",  levels=c("high", "low")) +
  random.factor("Subject", groups = "Age") +
  random.factor("Item", groups = "Material") +
  random.factor(c("Subject","Item"), groups = "Contrast")
design.codes(design5)
```

The design now contains `r nobs(design5)` planned observations for 4 subjects and 4 items. Each subject will be presented each item exactly once and an equal number of items (1) in each combination of `Material`×`Contrast`. Moreover, each item will be presented equally often in each combination of `Age`×`Contrast`.

For a more detailed example, see the `design-to-dataframe` vignette (by executing `vignette("design-to-dataframe")`) and the manual pages of the package.
